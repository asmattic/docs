File accidently created as text file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a file is created and for any reason is not registered as a ``.java`` file or ``.class`` file, follow these steps.

* Go to ``file -> settings -> file types``.
* Find the type that your file appears to be (check ``text``).
* Select that type and look for the name of your file and delete it from that file type so it can take it's rightful place as a ``.java`` file.
